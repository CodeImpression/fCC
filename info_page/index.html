        <p id="info">Médecins Sans Frontières are best known for projects in conflict zones and in countries affected by endemic diseases. The group is active in 70 countries with over 41,000 personnel. Impartiality is the foundation of Médecins Sans Frontières' mission. It distributes its aid without discrimination, giving priority to the people most immediately in danger. Médecins Sans Frontières acts in a spirit of neutrality and does not take sides in the event of an armed conflict. It may, however, be called upon to publicly denounce and criticize obstacles to its humanitarian assistance and breaches of international conventions.</p>

            <p>Silence has long been confused with neutrality, and has been presented as a necessary condition for humanitarian action. From its beginning, MSF was created in opposition to this assumption. We are not sure that words can always save lives, but we know that silence can certainly kill.</p>
